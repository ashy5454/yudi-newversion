<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to perform a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the Yudi application's landing page to make it more creative, Gen Z appealing, and engaging.

**Initial Landing Page Redesign requirements:**
- **Hero Section:** Split into two parts: one for text and the other for a motion graphic video demonstrating Yudi's usage (from persona exploration to voice calls).
- **Features Section (Why Choose Yudi):**
    - Convert the vertical layout to a horizontal, auto-swiping carousel.
    - Update feature text to be more casual and Gen Z-oriented (e.g., Talk like you actually text, Gen Z brain, not textbook AI).
    - Replace current images with suitable Gen Z-themed images or illustrations.
- **Languages Section:**
    - Apply 3D effects and heavy animation to the language blocks (Hindi, Telugu, English).
    - Make the word-flipping animation faster (around 2 seconds).
- **FAQ Section:**
    - Add a new set of FAQs provided by the user.
    - Redesign the contact information section to be more creative and visually appealing.
- **Create Persona Page:** Improve the design, font, and overall appeal.
- **General Styling:**
    - Improve the header/title bar (font, size, alignment).
    - Reduce the thickness of the footer bar.

**Subsequent UI Refinements (after initial implementation):**
- **IMPORTANT:** User explicitly **cancelled** the request for WhatsApp/Twilio integration and asked to focus only on website UI changes.
- In the motion graphic, add a horizontal slow scroll of chat messages between the user and a companion.
- Remove the Your AI bestie awaits badge from the hero section.
- Remove the no cap, Yudi hits different fr fr text from the Why Choose Yudi section.
- In the contact section, remove the heart icons and use colors that better suit the dark theme.
- In the Languages section, remove extra languages, keeping only Telugu, English, and Hindi.

**Additional Feature Request:**
- Implement a Share your vibe social feature, allowing users to share their persona creation journey on social media to boost organic growth.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A Next.js and TypeScript application with a Firebase backend. The agent has completed a major redesign of the landing page as per the user's initial request. This includes a new hero section with a motion graphic, a horizontal feature carousel, 3D animated language blocks, an updated FAQ section, and improved header/footer styling. The most recent changes, based on user feedback to refine the UI, have also been implemented but are pending final verification.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing a second round of UI refinements requested by the user. This included removing certain text elements (AI bestie badge, fr fr line), updating the contact section styling, adding scrolling chat messages to the motion graphic, and filtering the languages displayed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user has **explicitly and forcefully cancelled the WhatsApp integration request**. Do NOT work on or mention Twilio or WhatsApp. The focus is strictly on the website's UI/UX.
- A Share your vibe social sharing feature was requested and approved by the user but has not been started. This should be the next priority after verifying the current UI changes.
- The agent has already performed a significant amount of UI work which has been visually verified via screenshots. The latest changes are minor refinements on top of this completed work.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. **User (Latest):** Aborts the WhatsApp integration completely. Re-focuses on UI changes: add scrolling chat to motion graphic, remove specific texts/icons, change contact section colors, remove extra languages. Asks to use illustrations if possible, otherwise keep existing images. (Status: **In Progress**)
2. **User:** Provides details for a complex WhatsApp integration using Twilio, including sender numbers, consent flows, and mirroring web logic. (Status: **Cancelled**)
3. **User:** Agrees to the Share your vibe feature and then pivots to a large new request for WhatsApp integration. (Status: **Partially Superseded**)
4. **Agent:** Finishes the initial landing page redesign and suggests a Share your vibe feature. (Status: **Completed**)
5. **User:** Confirms the agent should proceed with the dark, starry, Gen Z theme and confirms the  route for the landing page. (Status: **Completed**)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The build process failed once due to a memory limit and another time due to a timeout, indicating the environment might be resource-intensive during builds/installs. However, the agent was able to recover and run the dev server.
- **Mocked:** The motion graphic in the hero section is a simulated demo of the app's functionality, not a real video file.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Firebase:** Used for database and backend logic.
- **Gemini API:** Mentioned as the Soul Engine for chat responses.
- **Framer Motion:** Used for UI animations.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES. It was used after the initial major redesign.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
- **Test files created:** None.
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A for landing page UI testing.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent acknowledged the user's request to implement the **Share your vibe social feature** but did not implement it, getting diverted by the (subsequently cancelled) WhatsApp integration request. This is the main outstanding task.</analysis>
